# HYDROTSA
## Overview
The Hydrological Time Series Analysis (HYDROTSA) is a toolbox to analyse streamflow, precipitation and temperature data. The toolbox is programmed in C language so it is quite effcient computationally. The toolbox is integrated by the following modules:

- `utils`: This is a module that contain fucntion to estimate different statistical metrics.
- `tspre`: Preprocessing of time series (ts) such as completing mising data, checking minimum length of ts to perform analysis, montly, seasonal and yearly aggregation, etc.  
- `lireg`: Linear regression analysis to estimate trends and linear correlation. Autoregressive models want to be inluded.
- `freqa`: Frequency analysis of time series. Different probability density function are included. Parameters are estimated using the Maximum Likelihood and moment's methods.
- `specta`: Spectral analysis of time series based on Fourier Analysis.
